###Marketing Research Team:  
Is looking for a research page that randomly displays images of their products and gets peoples feedback on what products are most interesting. They want this data to be stored for multiple users so the data can be examined. Also, for data purposes, they want an average of how many times the image was shown vs how many times it was clicked.

###Developer:
